# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of three popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

## Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

#### Advantages:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Works well for small datasets.

#### Disadvantages:
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Quadratic time complexity makes it slow.

#### Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm in which the elements are transferred one at a time to the right position.

#### Advantages:
- Efficient for small datasets.
- Adaptive, performs well if the dataset is partially sorted.

#### Disadvantages:
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Quadratic time complexity.

#### Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n^2)

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm where the list is divided into a sorted and an unsorted region. The smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted region is selected and swapped with the first element of the unsorted region.

#### Advantages:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- In-place sorting.

#### Disadvantages:
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Quadratic time complexity.

#### Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
